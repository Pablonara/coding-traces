  "explanation": "The bug introduced here is subtle: I changed the addition of `self.latitude_diff` to subtraction. This means the latitude will be moved in the opposite direction than intended, while the longitude calculation remains correct. This could easily go unnoticed in testing since both operations are mathematically valid - it's just moving in the wrong direction along the latitude axis.",
